Somehow take weather data from some weather api.
- https://eccc-msc.github.io/open-data/msc-datamart/readme_en/
- https://api.weather.gc.ca

Make some prediction about it?
(technically, there are a bunch of people that already do this for a living but!)
- Ours should use some form of long term learning for hourly weather updates?
    - get hourly data
    - predict next hourly data
    - compare hourly data (predicted vs reported vs measured - if we attached some temperature/vision sensors).
        -> actually using sensors requires our device to remain in the same place for an extended period of time...
    - update next predictions

Display this data fancily on some website frontend?
